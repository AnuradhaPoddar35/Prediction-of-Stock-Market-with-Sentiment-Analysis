* Abstract: In this project, we perform sentiment analysis and machine learning on publicly available U.S news(From Google News) to construct a measurement of "market sentiment". These estimated market sentiments and previous days' Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJIA) values are fed to our model learning framework which uses linear regression and Self-organizing Fuzzy Neural Network(SOFNN) to predict future DJIA movements. We also implement a portfolio management strategy to make appropriate buy/sell decisions based on our predicted values.
